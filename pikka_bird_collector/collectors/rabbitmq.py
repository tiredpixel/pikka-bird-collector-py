    """
        Collector for RabbitMQ (https://www.rabbitmq.com).
        
        The collector is enabled whenever non-empty settings are passed.
        
        By default, core status and cluster status are gathered.
        
        For consistency, a port is required for this collector even though
        `rabbitmqctl` doesn't accept one, instead returning all information;
        this might change. [TODO review]
        
        This collector is slower than others, because of utilising a na√Øve
        Erlang data parser in Python. There might be a neater solution, or the
        parser could certainly be improved -- but it's likely good enough.
        
        Because of the difficulty in mapping Erlang structures to something
        suited to JSON, all 'values' are treated as arrays, with empty arrays
        changed to `None` and length-1 arrays unpacked. This gives sensible
        results in most cases, but be aware. :)
